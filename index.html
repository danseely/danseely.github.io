<h1># Dan Seely ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h2>## About me</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m a software developer based in Ann Arbor, MI, with an associates degree in computer programming and 7 years
    experience in the field. My strengths mostly lie on the backend (with Python and PHP comprising most of that), but
    Iâ€™ve done a fair bit of vanilla JS and React on the frontend as well. Regardless of technology or methodology, what
    I value most is a smart, capable team that can trust each other.</p>
<h2>## My work</h2>
<h3>### AdAdapted</h3>
<p><strong>Sr. Software Engineer -&gt; Engineering Manager</strong><br>
    <strong>2020--Present</strong>
</p>
<p>I came on as AdAdapted's first dedicated backend engineer at a time when the team consisted soley of our VP of
    engineering and a single data engineer. I was tasked with supporting a legacy PHP / Vue platform, as well as
    assisting in supporting a legacy Golang infrastructure. I then helped to build out an entire engineering team
    consisting of backend, frontend, data and UX/UI engineers, as well as a new set of services to take the place of the
    previous infrastructure, all in service of supporting the company's growing needs.</p>
<p>As the team asseembled, we began work to transitioning our codebase from Golang and PHP to a stack consisting of
    Python on the backend (including multiple 3rd-party API connectors), React JS on the frontend, Scylla and Redis for
    high-performance caching and ad-serving, as well as a full migration from AWS to GCP. We are building infrastructure
    that represents the technical cutting edge of adtech.</p>
<p>As I grew our engineering team to its current headcount of nearly 20, I also transitioned into a management role.
    I've been able to help the team grow and mature, while taking management workload off our VP. This change has been a
    great success, and I'm excited to continue to grow in the direction of technical leadership. I feel I've excelled as
    a leader even moreso than an engineer.</p>
<h3>### Nutshell</h3>
<p><strong>Software Engineer</strong><br>
    <strong>2015--2020</strong>
</p>
<p>My first year or so with <a href="https://www.nutshell.com/">Nutshell</a> was spent working closely with the customer
    experience team, where I built a close-knit relationship between them and engineering. I gave the CX team a closer
    connection to engineering than theyâ€™d had previously, with direct engineering response to customer issues and more
    insight into how any resulting work made its way into the engineering teamâ€™s workflow. Iâ€™m incredibly proud of the
    current state of Nutshell CX / engineering relationship; as of sevaral years after I left, there was still a
    rotating engineer staffed to directly interact with CX on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Later, I shifted my focus to the Nutshell PHP backend. It is mostly based on Symfony &amp; Zend, with REST, GraphQL,
    and JSON RPC endpoints, <a href="http://gearman.org/">Gearman</a> for async work, <a
        href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr">Solr</a> for indexing, and a handful of external APIs (MailChimp, Constant
    Contact, Intercom, Zendesk, Gmail sync, O365 sync, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api">Twilio</a>, <a
        href="https://www.fullcontact.com/developer-portal/">FullContact</a>). I helped with the implementation of a new
    GraphQL API, using the <a href="https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php">graphql-php</a> library.</p>
<p>I did a fair bit of work on the React/Redux frontend as well, which also contains some older <a
        href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> pieces. We used the <a
        href="https://www.apollographql.com/">Apollo</a> client to access the newer GraphQL endpoints. I wrote CSS when
    necessary ðŸ™ˆ.</p>
<p>The engineering team at Nutshell is incredibly close-knit and capable. I learned to rely on a great team -- and to
    provide the same for them.</p>
<h3>### HCR ManorCare</h3>
<p><strong>Software Developer</strong><br>
    <strong>2014--2015</strong>
</p>
<p>I worked on a tiny, scrappy infosec team inside a large healthcare company. In addition to monitoring device and
    network usage for malicious activity, we also pulled and analyzed network and application access data for dozens of
    products used by tens of thousands of employees.</p>
<p>To do so, I helped build a custom Python ETL engine that extracted application data from various vendor access points
    (including databases, APIs, and even CSV exports) and loaded it into our own MySQL-based analysis system. I also
    worked on a custom PHP + JS (<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> &amp; locally-hosted <a
        href="https://github.com/danseely/cartodb-install">CARTO</a>) presentation frontend for display of various data
    points, used by both the IT and internal audit teams.</p>
<h3>### Personal nerd stuff</h3>
<p>I've completed a few embedded microcontroller projects, namely keyboards. I've mostly worked with the ATMega32u4
    processor, and the <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware">QMK</a> C-based firmware compiler. My builds have
    included assembly of processor-embedded pre-built PCB systems, as well as hand-wiring keyswitches to a bare Arduino.
